Status legend: ✅ done · 🚧 in progress · ⬜ planned

**Current focus: Phase 3 — Assemblies.** Phase 2 (parametric core)
**converged 2026-07-15**: Sketching and Part modeling both flipped their
last gaps to ✅ (sketch dimension expressions + driving/driven,
constrainable spline fit points, and typed over-constraint diagnosis closed
Sketching; multi-loop-cut + pattern-a-cut closed Part modeling, held under
the showcase stress test). Interop stands at ➖ (STEP import shipped
end-to-end; IGES/multi-solid deferred). The F7 gateway-auth security gap
closed the same day (`36dc3d9`). Full evidence: `CHANGELOG.md`.

Both independent audits re-baselined 2026-07-15 and converge on the same
next step — **Assemblies** (product audit: "the missing project container…
every other gap is inside a single part; assemblies is the majority of real
mechanical work"). The architecture decision landed the same day
(`docs/design/assemblies.md`, `b378633`): a new `assembly` document type
(instances + mates, not a feature-tree extension), a deterministic in-house
`AssemblySolver` behind a protocol mirroring `SketchSolver` (no license-clean
3D constraint-solver library exists), and a phased v1 — instances +
placement + 3 mates (lock/coincident/concentric) + shared-mesh tessellation,
**"bolt two parts together and see it."** Sequenced into 6 Ready items
(`docs/BACKLOG.md`) plus 3 interleaved audit-debt items (MinIO mesh-store
swap, STEP re-parse caching, rate limiting).

Source of truth for "what phase are we in." Every commit that ships an item
ticks it here (and on `docs/BACKLOG.md`) in the same commit — see CLAUDE.md.

## Phase 0 — Foundation ✅

All buildable items shipped through commit 322a988 (including the full
code-review fix batch). Two items below stay ⬜ because they are
**environment-blocked, not build-blocked** — neither can be attempted in this
sandbox regardless of code state, so they do not gate the phase advance; they
carry forward as blocked board items.

- ✅ Loop blueprint from Next-Lane review (`docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md`)
- ✅ Direction docs: VISION, RESEARCH, ROADMAP, BACKLOG
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` constitution + `.claude/` agent org (agents, skills, workflows)
- ✅ Design mandate: `frontend-design` skill vendored (Apache-2.0) + standing
      UI/UX directive in CLAUDE.md/VISION.md, wired into frontend agents
- ✅ Monorepo scaffold: uv + pnpm workspaces (incl. `@loft/design`
      placeholder), `justfile`, ruff/pyright/eslint/prettier configs —
      `just lint` + `just test` green
- ✅ `packages/py-kit` service bootstrap (config, JSON logs, health/readiness,
      error envelope, arq queue client), unit tested
- ✅ Service skeletons + compose: `gateway`, `geometry`, `documents` boot on
      py-kit, serve `/healthz` + `/readyz`; one parameterized service
      Dockerfile + compose stack (db/redis/minio + services, healthy-gated)
      authored and config-validated; smoke + per-instance dev scripts;
      probes verified against bare-uvicorn boots (web joins compose with the
      web-shell item)
- ⬜ Verify full `docker compose up` on a Docker-capable host (this sandbox
      has no docker daemon — images and stack runtime are unproven).
      **Environment-blocked**, does not gate phase advances; first
      Docker-capable session picks it up
- ✅ Contract pipeline: OpenAPI generated from pydantic → committed to
      `packages/contracts` → `packages/ts-client` generated (`just gen`);
      drift check ready as `just gen-check` (CI wiring lands with the CI
      bullet below)
- ✅ Web shell: Vite + React + TS app with router, layout, and an r3f viewport
      rendering a server-tessellated cube from the geometry service via the
      gateway, with the `packages/design` token system (design-mandate debut:
      title-block inspector, one palette across DOM + WebGL) and live
      parametric dimension editing; proven end-to-end in Chromium with
      screenshots (`docs/screenshots/`). Honest note: the queue leg is still
      sync-inline — the pipe today is HTTP → gateway → OCCT → GLB → viewport;
      arq/redis queue runtime lands with the queue/storage items
- ✅ CI: lint + typecheck + unit tests + contract drift check + compose
      config validation as GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, four
      parallel jobs, uv cache keyed on uv.lock); workflow authored + every
      job's commands verified passing locally — first hosted run occurs on
      push (per-package path filtering deferred until job times warrant)
- ✅ Geometry golden-suite harness (first golden model: the cube) + STEP
      round-trip test — data-driven runner over `services/geometry/goldens/`
      (documented per-model tolerances, exact topology/mesh counts,
      byte-level determinism incl. interpreter-restart), STEP round-trip at
      0.0 measured deviation; evidence + gap list in `docs/GEOMETRY-QA.md`
      (`just e2e` wired 2026-07-10: `scripts/e2e.sh` runs geometry gates +
      Playwright, booting/reusing services itself; CI e2e job deferred)
- ✅ Community surface: README (truth-only — hero screenshot, honest status,
      verified quickstart, CI badge), CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY,
      CODE_OF_CONDUCT, bug/feature issue templates + PR template
- ⬜ Watchdog: stall-recovery routine armed per `docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md` §1.4
      (blocked on the loop actually running unattended — armed when batch
      chaining starts; does not gate phase advances)

## Phase 1 — MVP: sketch → extrude → export ✅

Complete 2026-07-11 — the `full-flow` Playwright e2e (commit ff6b226) proves
the whole vertical slice end-to-end in a real browser against the real stack:
register → create part → sketch → extrude → edit param → export STEP/STL.
Full evidence lives in `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/GEOMETRY-QA.md`; one line per
item below.

- ✅ Auth — email/password JWT via gateway, single-workspace
- ✅ Documents — parts CRUD + feature-tree persistence (create/list/get/
      delete, reorder, rollback-bar, versioned param envelopes)
- ✅ Sketcher v1 — plane pick, line/rect/circle/arc, 6 constraint kinds
      (coincident/horizontal/vertical/distance/radius/fixed) with
      keyboard-first verbs, DOF readout, conflict diagnostics
- ✅ Features v1 — extrude (add/cut), fillet, chamfer; per-feature rebuild
      errors surfaced legibly in the tree panel under the strict-prefix rule
- ✅ Viewport v1 — orbit/pan/zoom, evaluated-body render, feature-tree panel
      with select/edit/rollback (face/edge picking deferred — see Phase 2,
      gated on the topological-naming design doc)
- ✅ Export — STEP + STL, from bare shapes and from evaluated feature trees
- ✅ Golden models — 5 reference parts (`box-10x20x30`, `cylinder-r10-h25`,
      `sketch-extrude-40x25x10`, `fillet-plate-r5`, `chamfer-plate-d5`);
      every shipped feature is golden-covered at 1e-9, STEP round-trips
      0.0–1.26e-10
- ✅ E2E — `full-flow.spec.ts`: desktop + 1280×800 + a touch-viewport smoke

## Phase 2 — Parametric core ✅ (converged 2026-07-15)

Ready batches 1–5 shipped in full (commits 2531850…36dc3d9, 2026-07-11–15);
full evidence in `CHANGELOG.md` + `BACKLOG.md`'s Done archive. One line per
item:

- ✅ Topological naming strategy (design doc) → sketch-on-a-model-face
      (consumer #1) → click-specific edge selection for fillet/chamfer
      (consumer #2), both backend + UI.
- ✅ Full sketch session toolkit — all 12 constraint kinds, construction
      geometry, trim/extend, offset, mirror, sketch fillet/chamfer, splines
      (fit-point v1, then constrainable v1.1), dimension expressions +
      driving/driven, typed over-constraint diagnosis.
      **Sketching row flips ❌→➖→✅** (2026-07-12 → `a1c42be` 2026-07-15).
- ✅ Feature breadth — revolve, sweep, loft, linear/circular pattern
      (incl. pattern-arrays-a-cut), offset/datum planes, multi-loop closed
      profiles → holes (incl. multi-disjoint-loop cut), shell, draft.
      **Part modeling row flips ❌→➖→✅** (`3c23c73`), held under a
      4-part showcase stress test (`d8d3b87`); multi-body boolean is the
      one remaining scope boundary (BACKLOG Later).
- ✅ STEP import v1 — kernel (`4964fab`) → gateway upload → UI file-picker,
      with a P1 security wall-clock bound on the untrusted parse.
      **Interop row flips ❌→➖.**
- ✅ Measurement (distance/angle), design system (grouped-icon toolbar +
      flyouts), fillet/chamfer authoring UI.
- ✅ Mesh-store single-worker guard (engineering audit F1) — fail-loud v1
      ahead of the MinIO swap (BACKLOG Ready).
- ✅ Gateway auth-gate on geometry-compute routes (`36dc3d9`, audit F7 P1
      security) — rate limiting (F7's other half) is a BACKLOG Ready item.
- ✅ Product + engineering audits, Pass 1 (2026-07-12) + Pass 2 (2026-07-15):
      no P0s either pass; Pass 2 verdict **"yes for a part, no for a
      project"** — names **Assemblies as #1**, the pivot to Phase 3.
- Not carried forward as Phase-2 debt (independent, stay BACKLOG Next P2):
  performance-benchmark CI budgets, undo/redo across feature operations.
  `docs/COMPETITIVE.md` (first pass 2026-07-12) is now stale — flagged for
  the vision-steward to refresh against Phase 3.

## Phase 3 — Assemblies, versioning, collaboration 🚧

**Current focus.** Architecture decision endorsed 2026-07-15
(`docs/design/assemblies.md`, `b378633`): a new `assembly` document type
(instances + mates), an in-house deterministic `AssemblySolver` (protocol
mirrors `SketchSolver`; no license-clean 3D constraint-solver library
exists), and a phased v1 — instances + placement + 3 mates (lock/
coincident/concentric) + shared-mesh tessellation. Sequenced into 6 Ready
items on `docs/BACKLOG.md` (document model → solver core → mate-geometry
resolution → gateway endpoints → evaluation/tessellation DoD golden →
frontend). Deferred past v1 (design doc §5): distance/angle mates,
interference detection, exploded views, BOM formatting, STEP-assembly
export, flexible sub-assemblies, part-version pinning-as-default.

- 🚧 Assemblies: instances, mates/joints — **v1 MVP complete 2026-07-15 (all 6
      items, backend→gateway→frontend); "bolt two parts together and see it" is
      real end-to-end.** BOM deferred to a trivial documents-side read model
      once instances exist. **v1 #1 landed**:
      the documents foundation — `py_kit.schemas.assemblies` (Placement/Quat,
      the discriminated 5-mate union, MateFace/AxisRef reusing the feature
      signatures), `assemblies`/`instances`/`mates` tables (migration `0003`),
      and the owner-scoped CRUD API with OCC (`doc_version`), write-time
      acyclicity, and cross-document 409-with-dependents. **v1 #2 landed**:
      the `AssemblySolver` core (the flagged §2.4 risk) in
      `services/geometry/src/geometry/assembly` — protocol mirroring
      `SketchSolver`, quaternion 6-DOF free instances, a closed-form tree
      fast path (bolt-two-parts, no iteration) + a deterministic
      numpy-only LM fallback (no GPL), the full under/over/conflicting/
      not-converged diagnosis (remaining-DOF via Jacobian rank), proven
      against synthetic residuals (bitwise-determinism + fresh-interpreter
      restart probe). **v1 #3 landed**: mate-geometry-ref resolution
      (`geometry.assembly.resolve`) — `MateFaceRef` → `ResolvedFace` via the
      `on_face` `resolve_face_plane`, `MateAxisRef` → `ResolvedAxis` (circle
      centre + axis from `BRepAdaptor_Curve`/`gp_Circ`) via the `resolve_edge`
      picked-edge resolver, plus `build_assembly_solve_input` assembling the
      full `AssemblySolveInput`; the first REAL bolted solve (two plates, two
      holes each) lands the free plate at the analytic pose (`well_constrained`,
      ~1e-8), with stale/ambiguous/wrong-instance/non-circular refs raising a
      clean `AssemblyDefinitionError`. **v1 #5 landed** (the v1 DoD, "bolt two
      parts together and see it"): `geometry.assembly.evaluate_assembly` +
      `POST /api/v1/assembly/evaluate` — evaluate each UNIQUE part once (dedup
      by `part_key` → one content-addressed mesh shared across instances),
      resolve + solve to a solved world `Placement` per instance, analytic
      combined mass-property roll-up (Σ volumes, mass-weighted centroid,
      transformed-bbox union — no re-meshing/boolean); the solved transform is
      applied at RENDER time over the shared mesh. First assembly golden
      `assembly-two-plates-bolted` (solved transforms == analytic within 1e-6,
      combined props == roll-up, byte-deterministic across interpreter restart,
      shared-mesh dedup) + per-instance/per-mate error + diagnosis tests.
      **v1 #4 landed**: gateway assembly endpoints — `gateway.assemblies`
      proxies the documents CRUD (assembly/instance/mate create/get/list/
      update/delete/reorder) and `gateway.geometry` adds the
      `POST /api/v1/geometry/assembly/evaluate` proxy, EVERY route auth-gated
      with `CurrentUser` from day one (heeding audit F7). The principal reaches
      documents (`X-Loft-User`), never geometry (identity-free hop); upstream
      422/409/404 envelopes re-surfaced verbatim. Contracts regenerated
      (7 new gateway paths). **v1 #6 landed — Assemblies v1 MVP COMPLETE
      (all 6 items):** the apps/web assembly workspace (`/assemblies` register +
      `/assemblies/{id}`, sibling of the part editor) — a Components/Mates
      title-block tree with drafting **balloon** item numbers (the signature
      device shared by tree + viewport; grounded ⏚ anchor), the multi-instance
      viewport (each unique `part_mesh_glb_id` fetched + parsed ONCE, drawn per
      instance at its solved `Placement` via a scene-frame transform — dedup +
      render-time transform, never a baked combined GLB), mate authoring reusing
      the face/edge pick overlays (planar face on each of two instances →
      Coincident, circular hole edge on each → Concentric, two instances → Lock)
      → POST → re-evaluate → the free part **snaps** seed-apart → bolted
      (reduced-motion-aware), and the solve title block (status + typed DOF
      diagnosis + combined roll-up). e2e `assembly.spec.ts` (desktop + 1280×800)
      proves it live; `frontend-design` skill run; founder before/after shots.
      **"Bolt two parts together and see it" is real in the browser.**
- ⬜ Document versioning: history, branch, merge-view (design doc first) —
      the assemblies design doc's `ref_pinned_version` field is schema-ready
      for this; v1 assemblies track tip (design doc §1.3).
- ⬜ Realtime presence + multi-user editing via gateway WebSocket
- ⬜ Helm chart + Kustomize; HA topology guide

## Phase 4 — Interop & drawings ⬜

- 🚧 STEP/IGES import with healing report — **STEP import v1 shipped
      end-to-end** (kernel `4964fab` → gateway upload → UI file-picker,
      P1 security parse-timeout; **Interop row flips ❌→➖**), evidence
      summarized under Phase 2 above and in full in `CHANGELOG.md` /
      `docs/design/step-import.md`. Remaining: IGES, multi-solid/assembly
      (likely couples to Phase 3), sew/heal, blob-ref storage — BACKLOG
      Later.
- ⬜ 2D drawings: views from model, dimensions, PDF/DXF export — the
      product audit's honest #2/near-#1 counter-argument to Assemblies
      (smaller build, completes the make-loop for the single-part case);
      not sequenced this pass, founder chose Assemblies as #1.
- ⬜ 3MF/OBJ export; mesh quality controls

## Phase 5 — Agent-native & extensibility ⬜

- ⬜ Public Python scripting API (same code path as the UI)
- ⬜ MCP server: create/edit sketches and features, query mass properties,
      export — the agent-native surface (`docs/VISION.md` advantage #4)
- ⬜ Plugin/extension mechanism
- ⬜ SSO/OIDC for teams
