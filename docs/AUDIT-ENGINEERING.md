## 2026-07-12 — Pass 1: sketch-authoring + part-modeling breadth batch

**Scope.** Branch `claude/open-source-3d-cad-o7hl49`, HEAD `31c3ac4` (batch
`79fee47~1..31c3ac4`, 30 commits, +17k LOC): sketch trim/extend/offset/mirror/
fillet-chamfer/splines, part breadth (pattern/sweep/loft), offset/datum planes,
measurement — across geometry + py-kit + documents + web + contracts.

### Gate re-verification (ran myself, not trusted)

| Gate | Result | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| `just lint` (ruff + ruff-format + pyright + eslint + prettier) | **green** | `All checks passed! / 115 files already formatted / 0 errors, 0 warnings`; eslint+prettier clean |
| `just test` (py + ts) | **green** | `701 passed in 128.74s`; web `387 passed (33 files)` |
| Golden inventory | 12 goldens, each with in-process **and** cross-interpreter determinism gate | `services/geometry/goldens/`, `tests/test_goldens.py:181-234` |

No claimed-✅-but-untested feature found in the ROADMAP reconciliation; the one
stale sibling test from the datum widening was already caught and fixed in the
same batch (`d2e0862`, `packages/py-kit/tests/test_features_schemas.py`).

### What is genuinely solid (verified, so the groomer can trust it)

- **Service boundaries intact.** No `build123d`/`OCP` import outside
  `services/geometry` (grep clean across gateway/documents/py-kit/web); no
  Postgres/SQLAlchemy/psycopg in geometry; `documents/src` never imports the
  kernel; no kernel type is serialized (evaluation state holds `Solid`/`Plane`
  service-internal only — `features/evaluate.py:132-159`). `apps/web` has no
  direct :8001/:8002 references — gateway-only.
- **DRY funnels are real, not copy-paste.** `resolve_sketch_plane`
  (evaluate.py:169), `_resolve_profile_face` (:276), `entity_edges`
  (kernel/extrude.py:113), `combine_body` (:264), `build_profile_face` reused by
  sweep/loft (sweep.py:42, loft.py:57) are single-sourced and shared across the
  parallel feature kernels — no duplicated boolean/profile/edge logic across
  extrude/revolve/sweep/loft/pattern.
- **Frontend spline is a correctly-scoped visual approximation, not duplicated
  authoritative geometry.** `apps/web/src/sketch/spline.ts:1-15` samples a
  client centripetal Catmull-Rom for viewport ink/picking and documents that the
  OCCT `GeomAPI_Interpolate` B-spline is the source of truth. No kernel geometry
  leaked to the client.
- **Exhaustiveness enforced.** `assert_never` on the `SketchEntity` union in
  the mirror dispatch (edit.py:800-846) and the closed-union `match` in
  `build_shape` (kernel/__init__.py:136) make a new entity/shape kind a pyright
  error, not a silent wrong branch.
- **Determinism discipline.** Every golden runs a same-process AND
  fresh-interpreter restart-probe byte-identity gate (test_goldens.py:181-234).
- **License/dep hygiene: clean.** The entire 30-commit batch changed **zero**
  dependency manifests (`git diff … -- '**/pyproject.toml' '**/package.json'
  uv.lock pnpm-lock.yaml` empty). No new deps → no GPL/AGPL exposure this pass.
- **No TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX** anywhere in `services/*/src`, `packages/*/src`,
  `apps/web/src` (grep count = 0).

### Findings

#### F1 — In-process mesh LRU breaks evaluate→fetch under any horizontal scale · Severity Med · Likelihood: low today / high at scale · P2

`services/geometry/src/geometry/mesh_store.py:69` holds the GLB store as a
**process-global** `_STORE = MeshStore(64)`. `evaluate_tree` writes to it on the
worker that served `/evaluate`; the client then fetches the mesh by
`mesh_glb_id` on a *separate* request (api.py:127 `fetch_mesh`). With more than
one geometry process this fetch lands on a different worker and misses →
honest 404 → the mesh is effectively unfetchable ~(N−1)/N of the time.

- Masked today: `docker-compose.yml:141` runs a single geometry container and
  `deploy/docker/service.Dockerfile:87` starts uvicorn with the default **1**
  worker, so single-process compose is correct.
- But the same compose service already sets `S3_URL`/`S3_BUCKET`
  (docker-compose.yml:153-154) and the module docstring calls itself the interim
  §7.8 seam pending MinIO — the object-storage swap has **not** happened, so the
  product's "cloud-native / self-hostable / k8s later" claim (VISION/CLAUDE.md)
  is not yet true for the mesh path. `uvicorn --workers 2` or one k8s replica
  bump silently breaks modeling.

**Risk scenario:** operator scales geometry to 2 replicas for throughput; every
other model evaluation returns a viewport with no mesh.
**Recommend:** either land the object-storage backend (§7.8) before any
multi-replica deploy, or add an explicit single-worker guard/readiness note and
gate the horizontal-scale claim on it.

#### F2 — evaluate_tree always tessellates + stores, churning the 64-slot LRU on export/measure · Severity Low-Med · Likelihood: med under mixed workload · P2

`evaluate_tree` unconditionally tessellates and `store_mesh_glb`s the last-good
body whenever one exists (`features/evaluate.py:895-898`). `export_tree`
(api.py:397) and the measure path reuse `evaluate_tree` verbatim but never fetch
that GLB — they read the `body`/`properties`. So every export/measure inserts a
never-fetched GLB into a **64-entry** cache (mesh_store.py:28), evicting live
meshes other users just created.

**Risk scenario:** a batch STEP export loop evicts the meshes of interactive
modelers, whose next `fetch_mesh` 404s and forces a re-evaluate.
**Recommend:** thread a `tessellate: bool` (or split "measure/body-only" from
"produce artifact") through `evaluate_tree` so export/measure skip the store;
cheap and removes the churn.

#### F3 — Stale in-code docstring: loft.py still says offset planes don't exist · Severity Low (doc-defect) · Likelihood: n/a (already wrong) · P2

`services/geometry/src/geometry/kernel/loft.py:30-36` states: *"datum planes are
origin-only and mutually perpendicular (never parallel), so two parallel offset
circular sections — a cylinder/frustum — are not authorable until offset datum
planes land."* Offset datum planes landed in `df308e4` (which is the **last
commit to touch this very file**, yet left the note), and the
`loft-cylinder-offset-r10-h30` golden encodes exactly that frustum — verified:
its `model.json` has feature types `['datum','datum','sketch','sketch','loft']`
with two `offset_mm`. CLAUDE.md classifies stale docs as a defect; ROADMAP
already reflects the unlock (docs/ROADMAP.md:14-15) but the kernel note was not
synced in the same commit.
**Recommend:** update the loft.py module note (one-liner: apex is v1 support,
offset-plane parallel sections are now authorable and gated by the golden).

#### F4 — Golden / determinism-gate gaps on shipped capability paths · Severity Med (QA coverage) · Likelihood: med · P3

The golden suite grew well (offset-plane extrude, loft-cylinder-offset,
loft-pyramid, spline-extrude, sweep), but three shipped paths have **no** golden
and therefore no cross-interpreter determinism/topology gate:

1. **`circular_pattern`** — only an in-process volume/bbox unit test
   (test_pattern.py:223); the byte-determinism test at :209 uses the *linear*
   pattern golden. Circular pattern is the most rotation/trig-heavy body op and
   the single one whose invariant isn't analytically pinned by a golden — the
   likeliest to drift across BLAS/interpreter. `grep circular goldens/*/model.json`
   → none.
2. **Boolean `cut`** — all 12 goldens are additive; no `operation:"cut"` in any
   `goldens/*/model.json`. Cut is unit-tested (test_extrude/revolve/sweep/loft)
   but never through the determinism/topology golden gate.
3. **Revolve / sweep on an OFFSET plane** — extrude and loft prove the
   offset-plane thread; revolve and sweep are noted in code as "same path,
   untested." No offset-plane golden exercises them.

**Recommend (priority order):** add a **circular-pattern golden** first (closes
the widest determinism gap), then a **cut golden**, then a
**revolve-or-sweep-on-offset golden**. Each is ~30 lines of `model.json` +
hand-derived `expected.json`.

#### F5 — Ad-hoc epsilon + narrow guard in the spline profile builder · Severity Low · Likelihood: low · P3

`kernel/extrude.py:186` hardcodes `abs_tol=1e-9` inline for the coincident
fit-point check instead of a named tolerance (the module already exports
`PROFILE_WIRE_TOLERANCE`); CLAUDE.md names ad-hoc geometry epsilons as a defect
class. Separately, that guard only rejects **consecutive** coincident fit points
(the `zip(points, points[1:])` at :185). Non-consecutive coincidence
(`points[0] == points[2]`) passes the guard into OCCT `GeomAPI_Interpolate`; if
that raises, the outcome is the generic `evaluation_failed` catch-all
(evaluate.py:777) rather than a legible `profile_*` code — and no test covers
the non-consecutive case.
**Recommend:** promote the epsilon to a named constant; add a test for
non-consecutive coincident fit points and decide the intended outcome (accept a
self-touching interpolant vs. a clean profile error).

### Loop-health / process notes

- ROADMAP "Current focus" matches `git log` (Phase 2, offset/datum + loft UI as
  the most recent items) — no stale-roadmap finding this pass.
- CI-time tripwire (not correctness): the cross-interpreter determinism test
  spawns one subprocess **per golden** (test_goldens.py:217); at 12 goldens the
  py suite is ~129 s and grows linearly with the golden count. Worth watching
  before it dominates the batch-end gate; not actionable yet.

### Prioritized recommendations for the groomer

- **P0:** none. No security, correctness-showstopper, boundary breach, or
  license finding; all gates green on re-run.
- **P2:**
  - F1 — gate the horizontal-scale claim on the §7.8 object-storage swap, or add
    a single-worker guard, before any multi-replica/`--workers>1` deploy.
  - F2 — let `evaluate_tree` skip tessellation/store for export/measure callers.
  - F3 — sync the stale loft.py offset-plane docstring (fast doc fix).
- **P3:**
  - F4 — add circular-pattern (first), cut, and revolve/sweep-on-offset goldens.
  - F5 — name the spline epsilon; cover non-consecutive coincident fit points.
